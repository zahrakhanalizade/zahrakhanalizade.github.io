Interdependencies between units in online two-sided marketplaces complicate estimating causal effects in experimental settings. We propose a novel experimental design to mitigate the interference bias in estimating the **total average treatment effect (TATE)** of item-side interventions in online two-sided marketplaces.

### **Our Approach: Two-Sided Prioritized Ranking (TSPR)**
Our **TSPR design** strategically prioritizes items based on their treatment status in the listings displayed to users. This method uses the **recommender system as an instrument** for experimentation, ensuring:
- A **coherent platform experience** by guaranteeing access to all items.
- A **consistent realization** of treatment across all users.

### **Evaluation & Results**
We evaluate our experimental design through **simulations using a search impression dataset from an online travel agency**.  
- **TSPR closely estimates the true simulated TATE**  
- **Baseline item-side estimators significantly overestimate TATE**
