## Personal Quests
- **Econ Coding:**  
  I'm on a mission to level up my econ coding game, from econometrics and causal ML to data structures, algorithms, and anything techy that intersects with economics.  
  📂 Here's my repo with some coding exercises, still a work in progress, and I’ll be adding more over time: [Econ Coding on GitHub](https://github.com/zahrakhanalizade/econ_coding)  

- **Research Interests:**  
  - **Experimental Design & Causal Inference:**
  *(Coming soon: A dive into the literature ...)*
  - **Labor Economics:**  
  I'm exploring women's labor force participation, gender gaps, and decisions around career and fertility choices — with a particular curiosity about how emerging fertility treatments influence these decisions.  
  *(I may share interesting insights and resources here over time.)*
