This is where I share some of my favorite resources â€” insightful articles, tutorials, and links that Iâ€™ve found particularly useful or inspiring.

## Resources I Find Useful

- **Matteo Courthoud's Articles:**  
  [Matteo Courthoud on Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/author/matteo-courthoud/) â€” great insights on data science and causal inference.

- **Causal Inference for The Brave and True:**  
  [Causal Inference for The Brave and True](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html) â€” an engaging and practical guide to causal inference using Python.

- **Online Causal Inference Seminar:**  
  [OCIS](https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/) â€” a regular international seminar where top researchers present recent work, followed by high-quality discussions.

- **Industry Tech Blogs:**  
  Cutting-edge insights on experimentation and causal inference in digital platforms from leading tech companies:  
  - [Instacart Tech Blog](https://tech.instacart.com/)  
  - [Netflix Tech Blog](https://netflixtechblog.com/)  

## Personal Quests
- **Econ Coding:**  
  I'm on a mission to level up my econ coding game â€” from econometrics and causal ML to data structures, algorithms, and anything techy that intersects with economics.  
  ðŸ“‚ Here's my repo with some coding exercises â€” still a work in progress, and Iâ€™ll be adding more over time: [Econ Coding on GitHub](https://github.com/zahrakhanalizade/econ_coding)  

- **Research Interests:**  
  - **Experimental Design & Causal Inference:**
  *(Coming soon: A dive into the literature ...)*
  - **Labor Economics:**  
  I'm exploring women's labor force participation, gender gaps, and decisions around career and fertility choices â€” with a particular curiosity about how emerging fertility treatments influence these decisions.  
  *(I may share interesting insights and resources here over time.)*
