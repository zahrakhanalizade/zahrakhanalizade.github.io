This is where I'll be sharing useful resources â€” from tutorials and articles to interesting links and ideas.

## Personal Quests
- **Econ Coding:**  
  I'm on a mission to level up my econ coding game, and I'll be dropping links and resources here along the way. This might range from classic econometrics to causal machine learning, data structures and algorithms, machine learning, and pretty much anything techy that intersects with economics!  

- **Research Interests:**  
  - **Experimental Design & Causal Inference:**  
    I'm deeply interested in topics like experimental design, causal inference, and the intersection of economics and the digital world! Expect to see thoughts, notes, and resources related to these areas as well.  

  - **Labor Economics:**  
    I'm also interested in labor economics â€” particularly the factors contributing to women's labor force participation, gender gap, and career-fertility tradeoffs. I'm especially curious about how emerging fertility treatments influence women's decision-making in balancing career development and family planning.
