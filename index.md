## About Me

I am Zahra Khanalizadeh, a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Washington. I work in applied microeconomics with a focus on modern causal inference, including experimental design, machine learning methods, and survey-based measurement. My research spans causal inference in online marketplaces and other bipartite settings, the use of machine learning tools to answer causal questions where traditional methods are limited, and survey-based analysis of beliefs, preferences, and decision-making in fertility-career tradeoffs. I am advised by Prof. [Alan Griffith](https://econ.washington.edu/people/alan-griffith) and Prof. [Jason Kerwin](https://jasonkerwin.com/).

I am currently on the 2025–2026 job market.   
Job market paper: [Two-Sided Prioritized Ranking: A Coherency-Preserving Design for Marketplace Experiments](https://zahrakhanalizade.github.io/files/JMP.pdf)

Before UW, I completed a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and a master's degree in Economics at Sharif University of Technology, followed by a master's in Analytics at the Smith School of Business at Queen’s University.
