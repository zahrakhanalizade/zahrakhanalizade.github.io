## About Me

Hi! I'm Zahra Khanalizadeh, a 4th year PhD student in Economics at the University of Washington. My research interests span applied microeconomics, labor and development economics, causal inference, and experimentation. I am advised by Prof. [Alan Griffith](https://econ.washington.edu/people/alan-griffith) and Prof. [Jason Kerwin](https://jasonkerwin.com/).

I received my bachelor's in Computer Engineering and master's in Economics from Sharif University of Technology. I then spent a year at the Smith School of Business at Queen's University getting a master's in Analytics.

Feel free to reach me at zkhnl@uw.edu.
