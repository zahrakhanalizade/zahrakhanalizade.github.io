## About Me

I am Zahra Khanalizadeh, a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Washington. I work in applied microeconomics with a focus on causal inference, experimental and quasi-experimental methods, and survey-based measurement. My research studies how individuals make decisions in two main settings: online marketplaces, where I design experiments for causal analysis, and real-world policy contexts, where I use surveys to measure beliefs, preferences, and behavioral responses.

My advisors are Prof. [Alan Griffith](https://econ.washington.edu/people/alan-griffith) and Prof. [Jason Kerwin](https://jasonkerwin.com/).

I am currently on the 2025–2026 job market.

Before UW, I completed a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and a master's degree in Economics at Sharif University of Technology, followed by a master's in Analytics at the Smith School of Business at Queen’s University.
