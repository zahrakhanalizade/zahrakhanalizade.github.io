# About Me

Hi! I'm Zahra Khanalizadeh, a PhD student in Economics at the University of Washington. My research interests span applied microeconomics, labor and development economics, causal inference, and experimentation. I am advised by [Alan Griffith](https://econ.washington.edu/people/alan-griffith) and [Jason Kerwin](https://jasonkerwin.com/).

Before starting my PhD, I received my bachelor's in Computer Engineering and a master's in Economics from Sharif University of Technology. I then spent a year at the Smith School of Business at Queen's University getting a master's in Analytics.

This website is still a work in progress, but more content is coming soon...

In the meantime, feel free to reach me at zkhnl@uw.edu.
